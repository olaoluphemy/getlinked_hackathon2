# getlinked_hackathon2
A complete webpage for the 2023 hackathon challenge organized by GETLINKEDai. Built completely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 
It comprises three pages, a landing page, an inquiries page, and a registration page. All effects and animations were built with just CSS and JavaScript
I also got to implement some sort of form validation. 
With the challenge, I was able to put to use my knowledge of javascript and also make an introduction to making AJAX calls which helped me learn and understand some programming concepts a lot better, some of which were completely new to me at the time of participating in this challenge.
Attached below is a link to a video demo of the site and a live link to the site:
